# Cocoa-Way
<meta name="msvalidate.01" content="F2CE1613C439C59C4D742AC8049C1B5C" />

**Cocoa-Way** is a minimal yet functional Wayland Compositor designed specifically for **macOS**.  
Built with [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) and [Smithay](https://github.com/Smithay/smithay), it allows you to run Linux Wayland applications (like Niri, Sway, or generic clients) seamlessly on your Mac desktop without a virtual machine's GUI overhead.

*Demonstrating true protocol portability: The native macOS compositor (cocoa-way) seamlessly rendering standard Linux applications running inside OrbStack via Unix domain sockets.*


## ✨ Features

*   **Native macOS Backend**: Seamless integration with macOS desktop environment.
*   **External Client Support**: Host Linux Wayland applications via socket connection.
*   **HiDPI Scaling**: Optimized for Retina displays.
*   **Hardware Acceleration**: Efficient OpenGL rendering pipeline.
*   **Polished Visuals**: server-side decorations with shadows and focus indicators.

## 📚 Research

This project is part of the **"Turbo-Charged Protocol Virtualization"** research initiative. See the [paper folder](../paper/) for:
- Full manuscript draft
- SIMD benchmark harness
- Architecture diagrams

**Key Innovation**: Zero-Cost cross-platform Wayland via Rust trait monomorphization + SIMD-accelerated pixel conversion.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

*   **macOS** (Apple Silicon or Intel)
*   **Rust Toolchain** (latest stable)
*   **libxkbcommon** (keyboard handling library)

Install dependencies via Homebrew:

```bash
brew install libxkbcommon
```

### Building

```bash
git clone https://github.com/J-x-Z/cocoa-way.git
cd cocoa-way
cargo build --release
```

### Running

Start the compositor:

```bash
cargo run --release
```

Wait for the "Wayland socket created" message.

## 🔌 Connecting Clients

Use the included helper script to connect clients via SSH or local socket.

### Example: SSH Remote Client

```bash
./run_waypipe.sh ssh user@linux-host <Program Name>
```

### Example: Local Test Client

```bash
# In the cocoa-way directory, check test-client folder
cargo run --bin test-client
```
