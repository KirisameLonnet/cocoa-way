**Cocoa-Way** is a minimal yet functional Wayland Compositor designed specifically for **macOS**.  
Built with [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) and [Smithay](https://github.com/Smithay/smithay), it allows you to run Linux Wayland applications (like Niri, Sway, or generic clients) seamlessly on your Mac desktop without a virtual machine's GUI overhead.


## ✨ Features

*   **Native macOS Backend**: Seamless integration with macOS desktop environment.
*   **External Client Support**: Host Linux Wayland applications via socket connection.
*   **HiDPI Scaling**: Optimized for Retina displays.
*   **Hardware Acceleration**: Efficient OpenGL rendering pipeline.
*   **Polished Visuals**: server-side decorations with shadows and focus indicators.

## 🚀 Getting Started
