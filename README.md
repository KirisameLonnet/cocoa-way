# Cocoa-Way

**Cocoa-Way** is a minimal yet functional Wayland Compositor designed specifically for **macOS**.  
Built with [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) and [Smithay](https://github.com/Smithay/smithay), it allows you to run Linux Wayland applications (like Niri, Sway, or generic clients) seamlessly on your Mac desktop without a virtual machine's GUI overhead.
